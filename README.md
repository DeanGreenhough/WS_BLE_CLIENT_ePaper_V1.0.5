# WS_BLE_CLIENT_ePaper_V1.0.5
Client Side adapted from WS_BLE_CLIENT_ePaper_V1.0.4
Added WiFi event handling due to core crashes and working.
However, BTON fails to intialise BT, enum is in the correct state (esp.restart() used to reset.)
Believe there are hardware issues toggling BT/WiFi.......
use WS_BLE_Server_V1.0.1 for Server Side and add your own WiFi Credentials. MQTT IP admin  password required
